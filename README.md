## üíª About the project

The Booking System is a web reservation application that allows users to view available venues and make bookings. This system consists of a frontend developed in Angular and a backend with microservices implemented using Spring Boot.

---
## Architecture
The architecture of the Booking System is based on microservices to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of maintenance. The key components include:

    Frontend (Angular): 
        Interactive user interface for users to interact with the system.

    Backend (Spring Boot Microservices): 
        Microservices providing APIs for authentication, booking management, venues, and 
        notifications.

    Database (PostgreSQL): 
        Relational data storage for users, venues, and bookings.

    Scalability and Fault Tolerance: 
        Utilization of Docker and Kubernetes for horizontal scalability and fault 
        tolerance strategies in microservices.

---
## Features
     - User Authentication:
        Login and generation of JWT token for secure authentication.
     - Viewing Available Venues:
        Users can view a list of venues available for booking.
     - Bookings: 
        Users can make, cancel, and view their bookings.
     - Notifications:
        Sending notifications to users regarding their bookings.

## üõ† Prerequisites

Before running the Booking System on your local machine, make sure you have installed the following:

- Backend: **[Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://openjdk.java.net/install/)**, **[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/)**'
- Frontend: **[Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download)**, **[Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)**
- Container orchestration: **[Kubernetes (optional for cluster deployment)](https://kubernetes.io/)**
- Container: **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration and Installation

**Frontend (Angular)**

Clone the frontend repository:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/D4GUR4SU/booking-system-frontend.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash 
cd booking-system-frontend
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash 
ng serve
```

Access the application in the browser at ```http://localhost:4200```.

**Backend (Spring Boot Microservices)**

Clone the backend repository:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/D4GUR4SU/booking-system-backend.git
```
Import the project into your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).

Start the microservices individually (AuthService, BookingService, VenueService, NotificationService) by running each as a Spring Boot application.

Make sure to correctly configure the connection properties to the PostgreSQL database in the ```application.properties```  file.

## Usage
    After setting up and starting both the frontend and backend, you can access the 
    application in the browser and begin using the booking functionalities.
